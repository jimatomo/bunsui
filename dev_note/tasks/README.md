# Development Tasks

This directory contains individual development task files and templates for tracking project progress.

## Task Management

### Using the Task Template

1. Copy `task-template.md` to create a new task file
2. Use the naming convention: `task-[brief-description]-[YYYY-MM-DD].md`
3. Fill in all relevant sections based on the task type
4. Update progress regularly as work continues

### Task File Structure

Each task file should include:
- **Task Information**: Basic metadata (ID, title, priority, etc.)
- **Description**: Clear explanation of what needs to be done
- **Requirements**: Functional and non-functional requirements
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Specific criteria for task completion
- **Technical Details**: Implementation approach and dependencies
- **Progress Tracking**: Status updates and time logging
- **Review**: Code review and testing status
- **Completion Checklist**: Final verification steps

### Task Status Workflow

1. **Not Started**: Task is created but work hasn't begun
2. **In Progress**: Active development is underway
3. **Review**: Code is ready for review
4. **Testing**: Code is being tested
5. **Completed**: Task is finished and deployed

### Best Practices

- **Regular Updates**: Update task status and progress daily
- **Time Tracking**: Log hours spent on each task
- **Documentation**: Keep notes about decisions and challenges
- **Links**: Include links to related issues, PRs, and documentation
- **Cleanup**: Archive completed tasks periodically

### Task Types

- **Feature**: New functionality development
- **Bug**: Bug fixes and issue resolution
- **Refactor**: Code improvements and restructuring
- **Documentation**: Documentation updates and creation
- **Research**: Investigation and analysis tasks

### Priority Levels

- **High**: Critical path items, blocking other work
- **Medium**: Important but not blocking
- **Low**: Nice-to-have features or improvements
